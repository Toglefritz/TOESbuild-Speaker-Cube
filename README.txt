The TOESbuild speaker cube is a posable, musical companion. The body of the TOESbuild
is a BOSEbuild speaker cube, the top and bottom panels of which have been replaced by 
posable eyes and legs. 

The eye and both legs are posable using a system of 3D-printed ball and socket joints.
This type of joint allows the TOESbuild speaker cube to be posed in any posture you want.

The bottom plate of the TOESbuild speaker serves as the "hip." It features two sockets. 
The TOESbuild feet also feature a spherical socket on each foot. The feet are connected to
hip using a "bone" that is basically a rod with two spheres, one on each end.

The top plate of the TOES build speaker cube functions similarly to the bottom plate, except
that the top plate has only one spherical socket. On top of another "bone" piece sites the eyes.

To make 3D printing the parts easier, the eyes can be printed in two parts. There is a backing 
plate which has the actual socket for the bone. The backing plate screws onto the eye plate. One
advantage of this design is that you can customize the look of the eyes without worrying about the
structure of the ball and socket linkages.
